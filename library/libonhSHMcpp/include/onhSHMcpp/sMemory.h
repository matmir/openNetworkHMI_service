 * 			Client - Server communication description.
 *
 *				Communication is realized based on Client - Server concept: client sends request, server is responding.
 * 				There is only one server and one client!
 *
 * 				If client wants to send request to server he lock requestMutex, check that requestIn, replyIn are 0, write command data,
 * 				set requestIn=1, unlock requestMutex and wait on signal from replyCondvar variable.
 *
 *				Server is checking in loop requestIn flag (if requestMutex is locked, he skipped - pthread_mutex_trylock).
 *				If requestIn is set he read request data, writes reply data, set requestIn=0, replyIn=1 and send signal to replyCondvar variable.
 *
 *				When client receive signal from replyCondvar he read reply and clear replyIn flag.
 *
 *			Client - Server process data exchange description.
 *
 *				If client wants to read process data he lock processMutex, read data and unlock processMutex.
 *
 *				If server wants to write process data he try to lock processMutex - pthread_mutex_trylock, write data and unlock processMutex.
