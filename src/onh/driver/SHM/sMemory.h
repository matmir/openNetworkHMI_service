/**
 * 			Client - Server communication description.
 *
 *				Communication is realized based on Client - Server concept: client sends a request and the server is responding.
 * 				There is only one server and one client!
 *
 * 				If a client wants to send a request to the server, locks requestMutex, check that requestIn, replyIn are 0, write the command data,
 * 				set requestIn=1, unlock requestMutex and wait on signal from replyCondvar variable.
 *
 *				The server checks the requestIn flag in the loop.
 *				If the requestIn is set, reads request data, executes request command, writes reply data, set requestIn=0,
 *				replyIn=1 and send signal to the replyCondvar variable.
 *
 *				When the client receives a signal from the replyCondvar, reads reply and clears replyIn flag.
 *
 *			Client - Server process data exchange description.
 *
 *				If a client wants to read the process data, locks processMutex, reads data and unlocks processMutex.
 *
 *				If the server wants to write the process data, tries to lock processMutex, writes data and unlocks processMutex.
